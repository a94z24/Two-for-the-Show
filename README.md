# Two-for-the-Show
This app will be for people who like to go to live concerts but may not have anyone to go with. The goal will be to match two or more people up who would like to go to the same concert, letting people who may not have been comfortable going on their own to see their favorite bands live. The app will be mostly targeted at people who have recently moved (Ex. for college or a new job) and may not know too many people in their area.
